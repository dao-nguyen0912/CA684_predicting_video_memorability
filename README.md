# Video Memorability Prediction: An investigation of the performance of Regression Models
# Abstract


Video memorability prediction task has recently gained a significant attention from the research community. This paper attempts to explore numerous feature fusion strategies on different regression models to predict videosâ€™ memorability scores that reflect the probability of a video being remembered to viewers. The research has been implemented based on the MediaEval 2018 dataset. A range of predicting techniques, i.e. Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model are utilized along with 6 state-of-the-art features and their combinations. The results have shown promising performance in the accuracy of the Random Forest Regression model with the different combinations of 4 features (C3D, Aesthetics, HMP, and LBP) which outperforms other predicting approaches.
